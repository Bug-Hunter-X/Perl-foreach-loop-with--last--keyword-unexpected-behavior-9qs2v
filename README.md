This repository contains a Perl code example showcasing an uncommon error related to the `last` keyword within a `foreach` loop. The `bug.pl` file demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version. The error stems from a misunderstanding of how `last` interacts with the loop's iteration. The solution offers a clear and concise way to achieve the intended behavior.
